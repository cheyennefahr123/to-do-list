# To Do List App
## Details 
* Hosting link: https://cheyennefahr123.github.io/to-do-list/
* This is a personal website to be further improved upon. It utilizes HTML, CSS, JavaScript and the React Framework to allow users to set to do lists by adding tasks with supporting links, priority levels and ability to remove when completed.
* Any user can access this webpage utilizing the hosting link provided above and will be able to add tasks to the list which will be saved locally. Once the task is completed the user can remove the task from the UI.
* Some future enhancements include: creating dynamic task cards so the task name is only shown with color coded priority levels, then once clicked the user can see any additional documentation that may be needed for the task and to include a calendar so the tasks can be displayed by due dates at a high level and utilizing the timer so completion time can be tracked in one UI.

### Media Stream Service Consumer 
As someone who enjoys watching shows on multiple streaming services, I would like to create a list of shows and movies that I am interested in with a link to the streaming service provider, so that when I complete a series I can move on to the next show/movie without researching which streaming service I need to go to.
